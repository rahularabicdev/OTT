              <b>Matched Identifier Communications from Spectraflix:</b> Some
              third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing
              about Spectraflix content or the Spectraflix service by sending
              privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy
              protected contact information means we use deidentification
              technologies to convert the original contact information (such as
              an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long
              alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the original
              information from being revealed. The third party compares
              Spectraflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy
              protected contact information in its own database and there will
              be a match only if you have used the same contact information with
              Spectraflix and the third party. If there is a match, Spectraflix
              can then choose whether or not to send Spectraflix marketing to
              you on that third party service, and can optimize and better
              measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your
              choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant
              profile) within the “Account” section of our website.

            Statement applies to their use of Spectraflix (except sections that
            only apply to the member, such as those related to payments). Please
            note that the member controls the Spectraflix account and all

            Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your

            account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles, and
            information within or associated with the profile (although, as
            noted above, you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile). You
